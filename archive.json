The bcp is certainly well-harmonized with the spirit of the Stakeholders draft and so I think the quote and link are appropriate, but I don't think we should go further than that.\r\n\r\n\"IETF Policy Interactions\" is a list of interactions between IETF efforts and policy efforts, again primarily as they relate to standards development. I do not think there is much of a link from the Interactions doc to this bcp, but in time it may make sense for the interactions doc to be updated with reference to this bcp.\r\n\r\nI am also almost completely guessing about the format for adding an informative link, so adjustments to what I've added would be much appreciated.",
