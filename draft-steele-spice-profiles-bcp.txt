           Digital Credential Profiles Best Current Practices
                 draft-steele-spice-profiles-bcp-latest

Abstract

   Digital Credentials are frequently modeled on documents, forms, and
   messages that enable a holder to prove they have attributes that are
   acceptable to a verifier.

   This document provides guidance to verifiers enabling them to
   describe their requirements such that they can be translated into
   digital credential profiles.

1.  Introduction

   Verifier's have digital credential requirements that reduce their
   liability, improve their transaction throughput, comply with local,
   regional or international laws, and support their environmental,
   social and governance objectives and values.

   Requirements are often expressed as "Policy Documents", and furnished
   to holders, in order to enable them to easily comply.  For example,
   sometimes to receive a new credential, a holder may need to present
   one or more existing credentials, and different regional agencies
   might have unique requirements regarding the quality age, and issuing
   authority of these credentials.

   Not all the attributes of a credential may be necessary to disclose,
   and the details of the serialization are often less relevant to the
   verifier than the authenticity and integrity of the credential
   attributes attributes.

   Verifier's need to update their policies as new credential formats
   become available, but still need to ensure that mandatory attributes
   are disclosed, even while changing the securing mechanisms and
   serialization details.

   Depending on how a verifier wrote their policy, the process of
   updating it in order to take advantage of new capabilities, safer
   cryptography, smaller message sizes, or advances in data
   minimization, can be difficult.

   This document provides guidance to policy writers, enabling them to
   construct policies that can be translated into human and machine
   verifiable profiles, enabling digital credential formats to evolve
   with the speed and precision at which policies can be written.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Ontology:  a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or
      domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.
      (oxford dictionary citation fixme)

3.  Ontologies

   Verifier's can share their view of a subject area or domain by
   acknowledging or leveraging ontologies.  Ontologies can be leveraged
   to model information requirements, with or without requiring the
   data' format to explicitly encode the ontology, or leverage the
   ontology directly in the construction of digital credentials.

   For example, the ontology defined in
   [I-D.draft-petithuguenin-rfc-ontology] can be used to describe the
   information required in a digital credential for RFCs, without
   requiring the digital credential to contain the literal strings used
   to serialize the ontology, for example the string:
   "ftp://shalmaneser.org/rfc#area", need not be present, so long as the
   verifier describes that the string "area" is equivalent in their
   profile text.

   Policy writers SHOULD distinguish between the information they
   require, and the ontologies that can express the concepts needed to
   understand the information.

4.  Information vs Data

   Information is abstract, it can be expressed many ways, take for
   example the statement:

   Alice believes Bob is 42 years old

   This can be expressed in many different data structures, and the type
   of data structure can vary while preserving the information.

   In JSON we might write:

   {
     "alice": {
       "knows": {
         "bob": {
           "age": {
             "42": "years"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   There are many different ways we can express the same information in
   a single serialization and many different serializations.

   Verifiers can write policies that mandate only one way to encode
   information in a serialization, and only allow one serialization, and
   this can reduce the cost to implement, and attack surface associated
   with support the digital credentials that are acceptable to a
   verifier.

   However, if a new serialization is invented, that is simpler to
   support, and more directly aligns with the values of the verifier and
   their mission objectives, having such a policy could prevent the
   verifier from adopting the new and improved serialization, even if it
   secures the same information and provides additional benefits, beyond
   integrity and authenticity, such as compactness, reduced computation
   and storage costs, or safer formal modeling capabilities.

   Policy writers SHOULD distinguish between the information they
   require, and the acceptable serializations that can express this
   information required.

5.  Schema vs Definition

   Once a verifier has documented their information requirements, and
   selected data formats capable of expressing the required information
   while satisfying their policies and values.

   The details of the acceptable data format SHOULD be considered.

   There are a number of subtle details regarding octet encodings that
   can lead to security or performance issues in digital credential
   formats.

   The first is understanding the allowed data types for expressing
   information, for example integers, floating point numbers, strings
   and boolean values.

   Policy writers SHOULD describe the allowed data types for the
   expression of information, and SHOULD NOT support polymorphic types.

   Schema or data definition languages such as [RFC8610] SHOULD be used
   when describing acceptable expressions of information models, so that
   validation of data instances can be automated.

6.  Designing Data Structures

   Although schema or data definition languages can help address some
   common security issues such as validation as described in [RFC4949],
   there are still problematic expressions of information which should
   generally be avoided even when fully specifying data.

   Most commonly deeply nested data structures, or lists of deeply
   nested data strucutures containing lists.

   Most digital credentials are about asserting attributes of a subject,
   in a way that is secured by the issuer, and provable by the holder.

   This can naturally be expressed using a simple map data type.

   subject-attributes = {
     ; identifier
     ? &(id: 1) => int,
     ; age
     ? &(age: 2) => int,
   }

   Strings and arbitrary length data structures SHOULD be avoided,
   whenever possible.

   As the issuer secures the data, the interpretation of the data is
   always in the context of:

   1.  the definitions published by the issuer.

   2.  the data the issuer chose to secure that expresses the
       information.

   Policy writers SHOULD leverage tabular data structures (tables, csv)
   whenever possible.

   Policy writers SHOULD restrict the data that is expressed in digital
   credentials and how the data is expressed not just the information
   that is required to be present.

   Policy writers SHOULD avoid making recomentations where the same
   information may be conveyed in many different, but equivalent data
   structures.  When leveraging CBOR, [I-D.draft-ietf-cbor-cde] SHOULD
   be used.

   Policy writers should avoid creating "frameworks" where
   interoperability is not immediatly available [RFC9518].

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

7.1.  Cryptographic Agility

   Registries / Pick at least 2, use at least N bit security... avoid
   MUST support.... recommend AT LEAST support.

7.2.  Internationalized Names

   Strings / domain names... Unicode.

7.3.  Exploiting Data Validation

   Max depth exceeded in JSON, cannonicalization timeout in XML / JSON-
   LD, similar issues with large CBOR structures.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
